Our method takes as input a photo exemplar of a real object and a 3D object with segmentation, and uses the exemplar to guide the assignment of materials to the parts of the shape, so that the appearance of the resulting shape is as similar as possible to the exemplar. To accomplish this goal, our method combines an image translation neural network with a material assignment neural network. The image translation network translates the color from the exemplar to a projection ofthe 3D shape and the part segmentation from the projection to the exemplar. Then, the material prediction network assigns materials from a collection ofrealistic materials to the projected parts, based on the translated images and perceptual similarity of the materials.</p><p><img src="/images/TMT_overview.png" alt=""></p><p>One key idea of our method is to use the translation network to establisha correspondence between the exemplar and shape projection, which allowsus to transfer materials between objects with diverse structures. Another keyidea of our method is to use the two pairs of (color, segmentation) imagesprovided by the image translation to guide the material assignment, whichenables us to ensure the consistency in the assignment. We demonstrate thatour method allows us to assign materials to shapes so that their appearancesbetter resemble the input exemplars, improving the quality of the resultsover the state-of-the-art method, and allowing us to automatically createthousands of shapes with high-quality photorealistic materials.</p><p><strong>For more infomation, please visit projectâ€™s homepage[add html here].</strong></p>]]></content>
